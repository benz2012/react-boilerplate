## Prerequisites

You will need to Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v6.x.x or greater

## Installation

Create your desired React app directory
```bash
mkdir my-react-app
```

Move into that directory
```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Download or clone this project, setting your app as the root
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benz2012/react-boilerplate.git .
```

Establish the boilerplate as a standalone project. Requires user input. Read the [inline comments](internals/start.sh) for more details.
```bash
./internals/start.sh
```

## Usage

Once the project is established using ```./internals/start.sh```, the following can be performed for development and production deployment.

#### Build/Bundle the Javascript & Assets for production use
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Run the Node/Express server in production mode
```bash
npm start
```
*NOTE*: The server will attempt to serve the statically built html/javascript/assets from the output of ```npm run build```, make sure this has been done prior to starting the server in production mode.

---

#### Run the Node/Express server in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Webpack will bundle the Javascript code using Hot Module Replacement, allowing for a quicker development cycle.

#### Lint the Javascript source
```bash
npm run lint
```
